# 3.6_ChangeResolution

1. Please note that the workingspcae is set as the personal GOOGLE DRIVE the runner of the code
2. Once we completed a training, we have download the best_model.pth, zip it and upload to the GitHub.
3. In this way it was easy to run the various tests since the directories are simplyfied. Also, in this way it was not important who writed the code into Collab, since once the git gets clone, atuomatically the best_model of the refence point was downloaded as well. Of course it has to be unzipped
4. It is required to have the **ZIP of the *DATABASE* uploaded into the PERSONAL DRIVE**
5. Please be aware that for the TEST run, the directory were the best_model is saved could change inside the file REAL_TSET.PY, so please control it before launching a TEST!
6. The changes related to the GeM implementation are done in to the *DATABASE_WS.PY* file (line19). THERE IS ONLY THE NEED TO RUN THE COLAB NOTEBOOK
